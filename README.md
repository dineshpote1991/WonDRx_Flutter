Please create an app with a list view that will load Michael Jackson songs from Itunes API and save in local db.
For the json data you can call the url below:
https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=Michael+jackson
 All the images should be loaded into the list view asynchronously for smooth scrolling.
Extra points: When an item is clicked open another activity to display some more details.
App flow : Rest API --> Local DB---> Listview
